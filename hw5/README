Assignment 5: README

I am most happy with the simplicity of my autocomplete/print_tree functions. I was also happy that I was able to create trie without storing full strings (instead I simply stored int flag to denote whether the given node is the end of a valid word).

There really isn't a part of my code in which I lack confidence, however I am least happy about the fact that I was unable to implement compressed trie in EC (ran out of time :( ).

NO EC COMPLETED.
